    <h1>Linking Mortality Burden to Research and Clinical Trial Activity</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We ask whether U.S. research funding, scientific publications, and clinical trial activity align with disease mortality burden. Using NIH RCDC funding, PubMed publication counts, and ClinicalTrials.gov trial data for 13 disease categories (2008–2024), we normalize research activity by 2023 mortality and predict each outcome from mortality in log space. We find large and persistent mismatches: <strong>Cancer</strong> and <strong>Alzheimer's Disease</strong> receive substantially more funding per death than predicted (largest positive residuals), while <strong>Respiratory (COPD)</strong> and <strong>Stroke</strong> receive far less. Results are partly robust across models (OLS, Ridge, Random Forest), but the ranking of diseases by “over-” or “under-resourced” depends on the outcome (funding vs publications vs trials). Trial composition also varies—Phase III and industry sponsorship are highest for respiratory, COVID-19, and liver/kidney disease, and lowest for obesity and stroke. These findings suggest that research investment is not proportional to mortality burden. Quantifying such mismatches is important for priority-setting, accountability, and equity: it makes visible which diseases receive more or less research than their mortality burden would suggest, and supports informed debate about allocation of finite research resources.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>How well does biomedical research investment match the burden of disease? If priorities were aligned with mortality, we would expect diseases that cause more deaths to receive proportionally more funding, publications, and clinical trials. In practice, advocacy, scientific opportunity, and historical investment create imbalances. This project quantifies those imbalances by linking three measures of research activity—NIH funding (RCDC), PubMed publications, and ClinicalTrials.gov trials—to U.S. mortality for multiple disease categories.</p>
    <h3>Why this matters (significance)</h3>
    <p>Research budgets and trial portfolios are finite. How they are allocated affects <strong>who benefits</strong> from medical progress and which diseases remain understudied. Studying the link between mortality and research activity is meaningful for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Priority-setting and accountability</strong>: Funders (NIH, foundations, industry) and policymakers are asked to justify how they allocate resources. A mortality-based benchmark makes it possible to see which conditions get more or less attention than their burden would suggest—and to ask whether that pattern is intentional (e.g. strategic focus on tractable diseases) or an unintended by-product of advocacy and history.</li>
      <li><strong>Equity and burden of disease</strong>: If research follows mortality, populations bearing the greatest burden of death are not systematically underserved by science. Large negative residuals (e.g. COPD, stroke) highlight areas where mortality is high but research input is low—potential gaps from an equity or burden-of-disease perspective.</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity cost</strong>: Dollars and trials directed to one disease cannot be used elsewhere. Quantifying “over-” and “under-resourcing” relative to mortality does not by itself say what the right allocation is, but it informs debate about whether the current mix is desirable or whether some rebalancing could improve total health impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency and reproducibility</strong>: A simple, reproducible index built from public data (RCDC, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov) gives advocates, researchers, and legislators a common reference. It can be updated over time to track whether the system moves toward or away from burden-based alignment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We merge public data into a single disease-by-year and disease-level dataset, then normalize activity by 2023 mortality so that diseases can be compared fairly. We use regression (and machine-learning variants) to predict research activity from mortality; the <strong>residual</strong> for each disease indicates whether it receives more (positive) or less (negative) research than expected. We also describe trial composition (Phase III share, industry vs non-industry) across diseases. The goal is to identify systematic mismatches and to provide a reproducible index that can support the kinds of conversations above.</p>

    <h2>1. Data sources and merge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PubMed</strong>: Yearly publication counts per disease (E-utilities API / timeline exports).</li>
      <li><strong>NIH RCDC</strong>: Yearly funding (millions USD) and 2023 U.S. mortality per disease category.</li>
      <li><strong>ClinicalTrials.gov</strong>: Study-level exports with Start Date, Phases, Funder Type (industry vs non-industry).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We merged these into a single <strong>disease × year</strong> table (2008–2024) and a <strong>disease-level</strong> summary. Diseases included are those with CTG data: Alzheimer's Disease, Cancer, Cardiovascular, COVID-19, Infectious Diseases, Immunization, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Mental Health, Neonatal, Obesity, Respiratory (COPD), Stroke.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>What we found.</strong> Research activity—funding, publications, and trials—is not proportional to mortality burden. Among 10 diseases with RCDC mortality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Funding per death:</strong> Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease are consistently above expectation; Respiratory (COPD) and Stroke are far below. COPD has the largest negative residual (~−2.2 in log space), despite high mortality.</li>
      <li><strong>Publications per death:</strong> Cancer and COVID-19 rank highest relative to mortality; Alzheimer's and Stroke rank lowest. The publication ranking differs from the funding ranking (e.g. Alzheimer's is over-funded but under-published per death).</li>
      <li><strong>Trials per death:</strong> Cancer, Neonatal, Respiratory (COPD), and Cardiovascular have more trials per death than expected; Alzheimer's and Stroke have the fewest relative to burden.</li>
      <li><strong>Trial composition:</strong> Phase III and industry shares are highest for respiratory, COVID-19, and liver/kidney disease, and lowest for obesity and stroke—suggesting different translation and industry engagement across areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> The significance of this work is that it makes the gap between mortality burden and research effort visible and quantifiable. Mismatches may reflect advocacy, scientific opportunity, or historical path-dependence rather than explicit burden-based prioritization—but without measurement, those trade-offs stay implicit. This index gives funders and policymakers a tool to flag relatively under-resourced areas (e.g. COPD, stroke), to ask whether over-resourcing in some areas is justified by other goals (e.g. scientific tractability, political mandate), and to track over time whether the system moves toward greater alignment with burden. The analysis does not prescribe optimal allocation; it supports informed debate and accountability.</p>
    <p><strong>Caveat.</strong> We use a single year of mortality (2023) and one definition of disease categories; rankings are sensitive to the choice of outcome (funding vs publications vs trials). Robustness checks (Ridge, Random Forest) show that the broad story holds but that the exact ordering can change with the model.</p>

    <h2>6. Deeper research: drug targets, molecular structure, and success</h2>
    <p>To make the project competitive for a science fair, we use <strong>granular drug/patent data</strong> (USPTO-style drugs and biologics) to ask: <em>What kind of novelty (target, receptor, molecular structure) is associated with patents, funding, or successful development?</em> and <em>Do the diseases that receive the most funding also show the most target diversity or the highest share of drugs reaching launch?</em></p>
    <p>We linked each drug product to a disease via Condition/Therapeutic Group, then computed per disease: <strong>drug count</strong>, <strong>unique drug targets</strong> (receptor/molecular target count), <strong>mean molecular weight</strong> (proxy for structural complexity), and <strong>share launched</strong> (Highest Phase = Launched). This lets us compare “research depth” and “translation success” across diseases and relate them to funding.</p>

    <p><strong>Feasibility of ML on target/receptor/structure:</strong> The same dataset has <strong>Target</strong> (receptor/gene names), <strong>Smiles</strong> (molecular structure), <strong>Mechanism of Action</strong>, and <strong>Highest Phase</strong>. We can (1) predict <em>Launched vs not</em> from disease + molecular features (e.g. log(MW), target count, or SMILES-derived fingerprints via RDKit) to see what kind of novelty or structure is associated with success; (2) test whether diseases with more funding have higher share launched or more target diversity; (3) cluster drugs by target or structure and see which clusters get more funding or trials. This gives a clear “research deeper” angle: <em>not only who gets funding, but what kind of science (targets, structure) tends to get patented and translated.</em></p>

    <h2>8. Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>RCDC 2023 mortality is a single year; some categories (e.g. Immunization, Infectious Diseases, Mental Health) have no mortality in RCDC.</li>
      <li>CTG disease labels and RCDC category names were matched by hand; minor mismatches possible.</li>
      <li>ML is used for robustness of rankings, not causal inference.</li>

    <h2>9. Making it more meaningful: using granular and USPTO data</h2>
    <p>We have <strong>granular data</strong> that can strengthen the project and make it more publishable and policy-relevant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>USPTO / drugs and biologics</strong>: The project includes a large set of drug/patent records (<code>Feb_8/drugs_and_biologics/</code>) with <strong>Condition</strong>, <strong>Therapeutic Group</strong>, <strong>Highest Phase</strong>, <strong>Product Available Since</strong>, and <strong>Organization</strong>. A script <code>link_drugs_to_diseases.py</code> maps these to our disease categories and outputs <strong>drug product counts per disease</strong> and <strong>drugs per death</strong>. This gives a fourth dimension of research output (patent/drug pipeline) to compare with funding, publications, and trials.</li>
      <li><strong>Add drugs per death to the mismatch index and ML</strong>: Run the drug–disease linkage on the full set of xlsx files (e.g. <code>python link_drugs_to_diseases.py --max-files 0</code>), then add <em>log(drugs per death)</em> as a fourth outcome predicted from mortality. Rank diseases by residual—which have more or fewer drug products per death than expected? This directly addresses “who gets new drugs” and strengthens the narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>Translational pipeline over time</strong>: Use <strong>Product Available Since</strong> (and patent dates if available) to build disease-year counts of new drugs/patents. Plot drugs per death (or patents per death) over time alongside trials per death and funding per death. This shows whether the pipeline is shifting toward or away from high-burden diseases.</li>
      <li><strong>Sponsor and organization analysis</strong>: The drug data include <strong>Organization</strong>; CTG has sponsor per trial. For each disease, characterize concentration (e.g. share of trials or drugs from top 5 sponsors) and compare industry vs non-industry across under- vs over-resourced diseases. This speaks to Hypothesis 3 and to “who is driving R&amp;D” in each area.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypothesis 4 (translational language)</strong>: Use PubMed abstracts and simple NLP (e.g. keyword counts for “clinical,” “trial,” “drug,” “approval”) to measure “translational” tone per disease and year; correlate with trial activity. This tests whether more translational language in the literature predicts more trials.</li>

    <p><strong>Concrete next steps</strong>: (1) Run full drug–disease linkage and add <code>drugs_per_death</code> to the disease-level table and ML. (2) Build a single consolidated drug table (one CSV from all xlsx) with year from <em>Product Available Since</em> for time-series plots. (3) Add one slide or figure to this presentation: “Drugs per death by disease” and “Residual from predicting drugs per death from mortality.” These additions make the project more distinctive and science-fair competitive. Implement ML on Launched vs structure/target to answer what kind of novelty earns the patent or receives more funding.</p>
